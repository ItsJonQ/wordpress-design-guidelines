## Quick Start

### Cloning the repo

First, you'll need to clone the repo onto your computer.

### Installing dependencies

Once you've cloned the repo to your computer. Open up your Terminal app, and navigate to that directory.

To install dependencies, run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

If you're using npm, run:

```
npm install
```

### Starting up local development

Alrighty! You're ready to fire up local development! To do this, run the following command:

```
yarn start
```

If you're using npm, run:

```
npm start
```

The local development URL should look something like this:

[http://localhost:5800](http://localhost:5800)

And with that, you're ready to start exploring, designing, and developing! ðŸ™Œ
