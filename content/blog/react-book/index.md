The Road to learn React teaches the fundamentals of React. You will build a real-world application in plain React without complicated tooling. Everything from project setup to deployment on a server will be explained for you. The book comes with additional referenced reading material and exercises with each chapter. After reading the book, you will be able to build your own applications in React. The material is kept up to date by myself and the community.

In the Road to learn React, I offer a foundation before you dive into the broader React ecosystem. The concepts will have less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information about React. It explains general concepts, patterns, and best practices in a real world React application.

Essentially, you will learn to build your own React application from scratch, with features like pagination, client-side caching, and interactions like searching and sorting. Additionally, you will transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript, and that it helps you get started with it.
