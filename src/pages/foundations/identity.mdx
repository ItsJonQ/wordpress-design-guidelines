# Identity

Shortly after the WordPress project was born, Matt Mullenweg designed the original logo; it was simply the word “WordPress” set in the Adobe [Dante](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/dante/) typeface.

The WordPress logotype as we know it today was created in early 2005 by [Jason Santa Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com/). He used two Emigre typefaces: [Mrs. Eaves Small Caps](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mrs-eaves-ot/small-caps-ot/) for the “WordPress” text, and [Dalliance](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/dalliance-ot?tab=glyphs#glyphs/322943/77) as influence for the “W” mark. The design was later visually refined by [Matt Miklic](https://mattmiklic.com/) (formerly known as Matt Thomas, or MT) — the core design lead, who helped shape the WordPress brand from early on, and later further adjusted for balance and proportions by [Hugo Baeta](http://hugobaeta.com/), during the creation of this Handbook.

## Metrics

The Logotype is composed of the W mark, and the “WordPress” wordmark. The proportional relationship between the two are demonstrated below. The W mark dictates the set of proportions for the whole logotype, and the wordmark is half the height of the W mark. There is a set safety margin around the logo, that measures half the size of the W mark. These proportions define the relationship of the logo in the main version as well as the alternate version (the one with the W mark on top of the wordmark).
