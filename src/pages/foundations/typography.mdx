# Typography

The WordPress brand uses two Emigre typefaces for it’s identity – [Mrs. Eaves Small Caps](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mrs-eaves-ot/small-caps-ot/) and [Dalliance](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/dalliance-ot?tab=glyphs#glyphs/322943/77) – and [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) for everything else.

The logotype uses Mrs. Eaves and Dalliance, but those typefaces are reserved for the Logotype only and should not be used elsewhere.

## Open Sans

Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. Designed with an upright stress, open forms, and a neutral yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms. Open Sans has fantastic character support for multiple languages.
